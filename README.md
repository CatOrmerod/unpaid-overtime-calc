 # Usage

Entry user will represent the survey participant, who will enter details regarding hours worked, employment department, email, id, and whether they took a lunch break. Once the calculate button is clicked, it will display the total overtime hours worked for the year, in addition to a comparison to others within the same department as reference point. This information is then stored within our database to further enhance the quality by increasing sample size. 

Admin user has access to a login page with admin rights.
